# Conventional Release Labels

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

Automatically adds labels to pull requests based on [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org). These labels can be used with GitHub's
[automatically generated release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes).

    steps:

```
